# ‚ñ™Ô∏è scene 1:
## ü™ü curtain
**material:** <br>
tbd

**prototypes**
We tried two methods of opening and closing the curtains. In one method we used a servo motor to move a peice of carboard with fabric stuck on it. The other method was to use a pully mechanism to pull the curtain open, and we used elastic to pull the curtain shut.
We tested out two fabircs to determine if we prefer a certain thickness or fabric type.

We also tested serveral methods to pull the curtain open.<br>

## üßí child peaking out of window
**material:** <br>
tbd

**prototypes**
We used a servo motor tilt the the structure the child figure is one which allows it to look like its peaking out of the window.

Note on the door sliding mechanism: we will be using a servo idea that was initially set for the window.


# ‚ñ™Ô∏è scene 2:
## üèÉrunning
**material:** <br>
tbd

**prototypes**
We were inspired by the walkinig automata by [Federico Tobon](wolfcatworkshop.com).
This was our first prototype:

there were a few things we wanted to alter for the next prototype. We needed it to be running sideways, we also wanted to adde some arm movements and improve the protoype overall. We tested a few rode shapes until we found the ideal movement(this is the rode that determines the movement of the legs):

# ‚ñ™Ô∏è scene 3:
## üåä waves
**material:** <br>
for the first prototype -- cardboard and washers.
for the final - acryllic or wood, better defined mechanisms.

**prototypes**
We first designed the printing parts in Adobe Illustator and then used the laser cutting machine in the IM lab to make the cardboard pieces.
Amina has used [Federico Tobon's](wolfcatworkshop.com) alien wave piece as a reference to craft this prototype.

For now we have the basic mechanism and was wondering if someone could offer some pointers or feedback on how to make it move better/more efficiently. Namely, we are brainstorming on what type of motor to use.

Some of the questions that we still have and that would be beneficial to answer for the 2nd iteration:
- What do you think should move the wave mechanism in the back? Cams and rods? Servo? Something else?
- It would also be great to have two wave pieces move independently from each other, vs. having one static and one moving like in the current prototype.
